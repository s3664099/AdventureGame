# AdventureGame

A basic adventure game that I am developing to practice my coding.
When I was a kid I used to write a lot of adventure games using Commodore 64 Basic.
What I have been doing here is taking the concepts and attempting to create something similar using
Java as the main language.

I have gone back to redo this game, so this is the new one that I have started to write.

Added the model/view/controller. Added display to display location. Added controller to take input

Well, I should have been updating these notes. However, I have completed the movement functions, as well as
completing the open and close functions. I have also used an Abstract class and an interface for the exits,
which I will be doing for the items as well.
