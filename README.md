# AdventureGame

A basic adventure game that I am developing to practice my coding.
When I was a kid I used to write a lot of adventure games using Commodore 64 Basic.
What I have been doing here is taking the concepts and attempting to create something similar using
Java as the main language.

I have gone back to redo this game, so this is the new one that I have started to write.

Well, I haven't actually written all that much here. So I'll pretty much say that I'm up to the closeable
and lockable items.

Actually, it's been a while since I've touched this program. Anyway, I've added the lock/unlock and
the open/close for the containers. I will now move onto moveable items.
