# AdventureGame

A basic adventure game that I am developing to practice my coding.
When I was a kid I used to write a lot of adventure games using Commodore 64 Basic.
What I have been doing here is taking the concepts and attempting to create something similar using
Java as the main language.

I have gone back to redo this game, so this is the new one that I have started to write.

Well, I haven't actually written all that much here. So I'll pretty much say that I'm up to the closeable
and lockable items.

##22 January 2024##
Actually, it's been a while since I've touched this program. Anyway, I've added the lock/unlock and
the open/close for the containers. I will now move onto moveable items.

##23 January 2024##
Added item subclass for a moveable item. This item will hide either an item or an exit. Methods are added to check if the
item can be moved. Also a method and a boolean to see if the moveable item has already been moved.
Of course, this is only for hiding a single item/exit. It will need to change if it holds more than one item/exit, or even if
it hides an item and an exit. Oh, and also if it hides another thing if moved. Yeah, these adventure games can be tricky,
though we only need to do what is needed for a particular game, and can add further implementations as they arise.
